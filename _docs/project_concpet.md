# Magus Locale – Spellcasting for Local Language Testing

**Magus Locale** is a lightweight, local-first application for testing language models through a series of magical trials. Built with **Astro** and powered by **Ollama**, it enables quick, private, and customizable evaluation of text prompts.

## Magical Trials (Core Features)

- **Anti-Spam Charm** – Detects whether a message is spam.
- **Sentimentus Revealo** – Classifies sentiment as *positive*, *neutral*, or *negative*.
- **Promptus Quadratum** – Verifies whether the user’s prompt includes all four required elements.

## Why Local?

We believe magic works best close to home. Running models locally via **Ollama** means:

- Full **data privacy** – no cloud dependency
- Faster responses
- More control over your spellwork (i.e., your tests)
